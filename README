This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2979

This script defines a parameter text object. A parameter is the text between parentheses or commas, typically found in a function's argument list. 

See: 
:help text-objects 
  for a description of what can be done with text objects. 

Also See: 
:help a( 
  If you want to operate on the parentheses also. 

Like all the other text-objects, a parameter text object can be selected following these commands: 'd', 'c', 'y', 'v', etc. The script defines these operator mappings: 

   aP    "a parameter", select a parameter, including one comma (if there is one). 

   iP    "inner parameter", select a parameter, not including commas. 

This is a slick version of argtextobj vimscript #2699; though mine is shorter and can handle counts (ie. c3aP).

NOTE: Negative ratings don't help the script to improve. Instead, please send me an email (shown in my profile). Thank you.
